# Edge AI in Manufacturing: A Practical Implementation Guide

Edge AI is powerful when it augments operators and control systems without adding fragility. After deploying multiple vision and anomaly detection projects on factory floors, these are the practices that consistently deliver value.

## 1. Frame the Use Case Clearly

- **Defect detection:** Supplement vision inspectors with AI that flags anomalies operators might miss.
- **Asset health:** Monitor vibration signatures to predict bearing failures.
- **Safety compliance:** Detect PPE usage at workstations.

Prioritize use cases where AI can automate repetitive visual inspections or sift through high-frequency signals faster than humans.

## 2. Collect and Label Data with OT Reality in Mind

1. Capture data during normal and abnormal operations; schedule data sprints during planned downtime to avoid disrupting production.
2. Label data with process engineers and operators present—context matters.
3. Store metadata (line, shift, recipe) alongside samples so the AI model can learn process variations.

## 3. Choose an Edge Platform Built for Industry

| Requirement | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Harsh environment | Industrial PCs with fanless cooling and vibration tolerance |
| Deterministic integration | Use real-time Linux or container runtimes with CPU pinning |
| Connectivity | Dual NICs to separate OT and IT networks |
| Security | TPM chips, secure boot, signed model artifacts |

## 4. Model Lifecycle

```

- **Training:** Start with proven architectures (e.g., YOLOv8 for vision, autoencoders for anomaly detection).
- **Optimization:** Use TensorRT or OpenVINO to quantize and accelerate inference while preserving accuracy.
- **Deployment:** Package models as containers with health checks; use MQTT or REST APIs to integrate with SCADA/HMI.
- **Monitoring:** Track precision/recall and drift; flag when retraining is required.

## 5. Integration with OT Systems

- Expose model outputs as OPC UA variables or MQTT topics (`/line01/vision/defects`).
- Add configurable thresholds so operators control how aggressive the AI is.
- Log every AI decision with image snippets and metadata for traceability.
- Provide manual override to keep production running if the AI service is offline.

## 6. Change Management and Training

- Run pilot phases where AI decisions are advisory before switching to automatic reactions.
- Train operators on interpreting AI dashboards and acknowledging events.
- Document SOP updates and ensure maintenance knows how to restart or update containers.

## 7. Cybersecurity Considerations

- Sign model packages and verify signatures before deployment.
- Restrict outbound internet access; updates should flow through controlled CI/CD pipelines.
- Use VLANs and firewalls to separate AI edge devices from core PLC networks.

## 8. Measuring Success

Define KPIs upfront, such as reduced false rejects, decreased downtime, or faster root-cause analysis. In one project, edge AI cut manual inspection time by 40% and paid for itself in a single quarter.

Edge AI delivers when it’s tightly integrated with operations, supported by disciplined data practices, and built on resilient industrial hardware. Treat it as part of your automation stack—not a science experiment—and the results will follow.
