## The Missing Link in PLC Development

Industrial automation programmers have long faced a significant challenge: while the rest of the software development world enjoys robust version control systems, collaborative tools, and AI-assisted programming, PLC development remains largely isolated in proprietary environments. This disconnect creates numerous problems:

1. **Limited Version Control**: PLCs typically store their code in binary files that aren't meaningfully trackable in Git or other VCS systems
2. **No Diff Visualization**: Identifying what changed between versions is unnecessarily difficult
3. **Team Collaboration Barriers**: Multiple engineers can't easily work on different parts of the same project
4. **AI Programming Gap**: Modern AI coding assistants can't read or modify binary PLC project files

To bridge this gap, I've developed the **PLC Structured Text to Plain Text Converter** - an open-source tool that transforms CODESYS and ABB Automation Builder projects into plain text files for version control and AI-assisted programming.

## Unlocking Modern Development Workflows for Industrial Automation

This tool creates a bidirectional conversion path between your PLC development environment and plain text files:

The converter supports exporting and importing:
- Program Organization Units (POUs)
- Data Unit Types (DUTs) 
- Methods, Functions, and Function Blocks
- Task Configurations
- Properties, Actions, and Transitions

By extracting the source code to plain text, you unlock several key capabilities:

### 1. True Version Control with Git

With your PLC code in plain text format, you can leverage Git's full feature set:
- Track meaningful changes rather than binary file differences
- Create feature branches for parallel development
- Review changes with clear diffs before merging
- Maintain a complete history of your codebase

### 2. AI-Assisted PLC Programming

Perhaps most exciting is the ability to use modern AI coding assistants with your PLC code:
- Get intelligent code completion suggestions
- Refactor complex control logic with AI assistance
- Generate documentation automatically
- Identify potential bugs and optimization opportunities

### 3. Simplified Project Templating

The tool provides additional capabilities for template management:
- Generate reusable project templates
- Update projects from templates
- Standardize code structure across multiple machines

## Setting Up the PLC-to-Text Converter

Getting started with the converter is straightforward:

### Installation

1. Copy the Script Commands folder to your CODESYS or Automation Builder installation:
   - For CODESYS: `C:\Program Files\CODESYS 3.5.20.50\CODESYS\Script Commands`
   - For Automation Builder: `C:\Program Files\ABB\AB2.8\AutomationBuilder\Script Commands`

2. Open your PLC programming environment without opening a project

3. Select **Tools â†’ Customize** from the menu:
   ![Customize Menu](~/assets/images/1. codesys.png)

4. Select or create a toolbar, then click **Add Command...**:
   ![Toolbar Configuration](~/assets/images/2. toolbar.png)

5. In categories, select **ScriptEngine Commands** and add the **Export to Files** and **Import From Files** commands:
   ![Adding Commands](~/assets/images/3. commands.png)

6. You should now have export and import buttons in your toolbar:
   ![Export/Import Buttons](~/assets/images/4. buttons.png)

## Using the Converter: A Practical Workflow

Here's how to integrate the converter into your development workflow:

### Step 1: Organize Your Project Structure

First, create a folder under your Application to contain all elements that will be synchronized:

![Project Organization](~/assets/images/6. src.png)

**Important**: Only elements inside this folder will be exported/imported. Keep communication configurations and system components outside this folder as they're not supported by the converter.

### Step 2: Export to Plain Text

With your project organized, click the **Export to Files** button to extract everything to your filesystem:

![Export Process](~/assets/images/7. export.png)

The files will be generated in a path structure that matches your project:
`<Project Name>/<Device Name>/<Application Name>/src/`

![Generated Files](~/assets/images/8. files.png)

### Step 3: Edit With Modern Tools

Now you can open and edit these files with any text editor or IDE:

![IDE Editing](~/assets/images/9. ide.png)

**Important**: Don't remove the line `// --- BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION ---` as it helps the script distinguish between variable declarations and implementation code.

### Step 4: Import Back to PLC Environment

When you're ready, use the **Import from Files** command to bring the modified code back into your project:

![Imported Code](~/assets/images/11. imported.png)

### Step 5: Leverage Version Control

With your code in text format, you can commit changes to Git and track the evolution of your industrial control logic:

![Git Commits](~/assets/images/12. git.png)

Always keep the binary project file in your repository as well for completeness.

## Best Practices and Limitations

While this tool significantly improves the PLC development workflow, there are some important considerations:

### Best Practices
- Create a consistent folder structure across projects
- Commit both text files and binary project files to your repository
- Add meaningful commit messages describing control logic changes
- Use branching for feature development and testing

### Current Limitations
- Does not support exporting/importing visualization elements
- Communication devices may have limited support
- Recipe management should remain outside the export folder
- Tested extensively with CODESYS V3.5 SP20

## Conclusion: Bringing PLC Programming into the Modern Era

The PLC Structured Text to Plain Text Converter represents a critical bridge between traditional industrial automation programming and modern software development practices. By enabling version control, team collaboration, and AI-assisted programming for PLC code, we can accelerate development, improve code quality, and reduce the skills gap in industrial automation.

The tool is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/eduardojvieira/PLC-Structured-Text-to-Plain-Text-for-Version-Control-and-AI) and welcomes contributions from the industrial automation community.
