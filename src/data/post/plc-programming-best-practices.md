# PLC Programming Best Practices

After hundreds of PLC projects—from small machine retrofits to greenfield plants—these best practices have become non-negotiable. They keep code understandable, safe, and ready for integration with modern analytics.

## 1. Start with Standards

- Adopt ISA-88/PackML state models where applicable.
- Use vendor guidelines (Siemens SiVArc, Rockwell PlantPAx) as templates.
- Maintain coding standards for tag naming, comments, and language usage.

## 2. Modular Architecture

- Break logic into reusable modules (equipment phases, routines) with clear interfaces.
- Create library function blocks for common equipment (motors, valves, conveyors).
- Version-control libraries and document change history.

## 3. Safety First

- Separate safety PLC programs or safety-rated routines from standard control logic.
- Document safety functions and validate during FAT/SAT.
- Include safe-state routines in case of communication loss or fault conditions.

## 4. Diagnostics and Visibility

- Expose key states, alarms, and counters for HMIs, historians, and MQTT payloads.
- Log operator interventions and mode changes.
- Provide troubleshooting guides aligned with program structure.

## 5. Data Handling and Integration

- Normalize units and scaling before exposing data to other systems.
- Use structured text or function blocks for recipe management and data parsing.
- Implement buffers or store-and-forward mechanisms when sending data to the cloud.

## 6. Testing and Simulation

- Use vendor simulators (FactoryTalk Logix Echo, Siemens PLCSIM) before deploying.
- Create test harnesses for functions and sequence routines.
- Record test cases and expected results as part of documentation.

## 7. Change Management

- Track revisions in source control with descriptive commit messages.
- Review changes with peers to catch logic errors and align with standards.
- Backup PLC programs automatically and verify restore procedures.

## 8. Continuous Improvement

- Hold post-commissioning reviews to capture lessons learned.
- Train maintenance teams on navigating code and using diagnostics.
- Update documentation whenever new features or process changes are introduced.

Great PLC code is more than rungs and blocks—it’s a disciplined process. Follow these practices to deliver systems that operators trust and IT teams can integrate without headaches.
