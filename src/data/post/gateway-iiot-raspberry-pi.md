# Building a Production-Ready IIoT Gateway with Raspberry Pi

I frequently deploy Raspberry Pi-based gateways as agile companions to traditional PLC systems. With the right design, they can handle industrial workloads reliably. This guide covers the blueprint I use from hardware selection to security hardening.

## 1. Hardware Foundation

- **Model:** Raspberry Pi 4/5 with 8 GB RAM for ample headroom.
- **Storage:** Industrial-grade microSD or, preferably, NVMe/SSD via USB 3.0.
- **Enclosure:** DIN-rail case with proper ventilation and optional heatsinks.
- **Power:** 24 VDC industrial PSU with surge suppression and UPS backup.

## 2. Operating System and Base Configuration

```bash
sudo raspi-config  # enable SSH, set locale/timezone, expand filesystem
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose fail2ban unattended-upgrades
```

- Disable unused interfaces (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) if not required.
- Set static IPs on OT and IT VLANs using separate USB NICs.
- Configure systemd-journald to forward logs to a remote syslog server.

## 3. Containerized Services

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mqtt:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto:2
    volumes:
      - ./mosquitto:/mosquitto
    ports:
      - "8883:8883"
  node-red:
    image: nodered/node-red:latest
    volumes:
      - ./data/node-red:/data
    ports:
      - "1880:1880"
  collector:
    build: ./collector
    restart: always
```

- Keep containers lean and define resource limits (CPU shares, memory).
- Use Watchtower or CI/CD jobs for controlled updates.

## 4. Python Collector Skeleton

```python
import time, json
from pycomm3 import LogixDriver
from paho.mqtt.client import Client

TAGS = ["Machine.Temp", "Machine.State", "Machine.Alarm"]

client = Client(client_id="edge-gateway")
client.tls_set("ca.pem", "gateway.pem", "gateway.key")
client.connect("mqtt.company.com", 8883)

with LogixDriver("192.168.10.15/1") as plc:
    while True:
        values = {tag: LogixDriver(tag).value for tag in TAGS}
        payload = json.dumps({"ts": time.time(), "data": values})
        client.publish("plant/line1/plc", payload, qos=1)
        time.sleep(1)
```

Swap `pycomm3` for `pymodbus`, `snap7`, or any protocol client you need.

## 5. Security Hardening Checklist

- Enforce SSH key authentication and disable password logins.
- Implement firewall rules with `ufw` or `nftables`; allow only necessary ports.
- Use `fail2ban` to block brute-force attempts.
- Rotate certificates automatically using a secrets manager or cron job hitting a PKI API.

## 6. Observability

- Expose metrics through Prometheus Node Exporter and cAdvisor.
- Send logs to a central ELK/Graylog stack.
- Configure heartbeat topics to monitor gateway health (`/system/heartbeat`).

## 7. Maintenance and Lifecycle

- Keep a golden image with Ansible scripts to rebuild gateways quickly.
- Document procedures for swapping SD cards or hardware in case of failure.
- Schedule quarterly tests of UPS batteries and update cycles.

With disciplined engineering practices, Raspberry Pi gateways become reliable allies for IIoT initiativesâ€”accelerating data capture, enabling remote visibility, and extending the reach of your PLC fleet.
