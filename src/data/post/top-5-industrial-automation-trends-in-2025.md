# Top 5 Industrial Automation Trends in 2025

Automation buzzwords appear every year, but only a few translate into measurable ROI. These are the trends I see driving meaningful change in 2025 based on current client engagements.

## 1. Edge-to-Cloud Data Pipelines Become Standard

- Manufacturers are adopting MQTT/Sparkplug architectures to deliver structured, contextualized data to analytics platforms.
- Edge gateways host local dashboards and buffer data during outages, ensuring resilience.

## 2. AI-Assisted Maintenance Moves Beyond Pilots

- Condition monitoring tools using machine learning are now embedded in maintenance workflows, not just proof-of-concepts.
- Technicians receive recommended actions in CMMS systems, shortening troubleshooting time.

## 3. Cybersecurity by Design

- IEC 62443-aligned programs are becoming mandatory for OEMs and integrators.
- Plants invest in network segmentation, zero-trust remote access, and real-time threat detection.

## 4. Modular Automation Architectures

- Standardized PackML and modular equipment designs enable rapid line reconfiguration.
- Plug-and-produce concepts using OPC UA and MQTT speed up commissioning for new SKUs.

## 5. Workforce Upskilling and Collaboration Tools

- Mixed reality, digital twins, and guided workflows help bridge skills gaps.
- Bilingual documentation and remote collaboration platforms allow global teams to solve issues together.

### Bonus: Sustainability Metrics Embedded in Automation

- Energy and waste metrics are now first-class citizens in dashboards and KPIs.
- Automation projects include carbon reporting requirements alongside throughput goals.

To stay competitive, combine these trends with disciplined project execution. Focus on technologies that enhance reliability, empower teams, and deliver clear business outcomes.
