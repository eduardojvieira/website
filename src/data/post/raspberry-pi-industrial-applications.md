# Raspberry Pi in Industrial Applications

Raspberry Pi boards are not PLC replacements, but they’re excellent companions. I use them to extend visibility, prototype fast, and integrate modern services without disturbing validated control systems. Here’s how.

## 1. Common Use Cases

- **Data Gateways:** Collect PLC, Modbus, or sensor data and publish to MQTT/OPC UA.
- **Edge Analytics:** Run Python or Node-RED scripts for OEE, quality checks, or AI inference.
- **Protocol Bridging:** Translate between legacy serial devices and modern cloud APIs.
- **Maintenance Tools:** Host diagnostic dashboards, documentation, or VPN endpoints.

## 2. Hardware Considerations

- Use industrial-grade Pi models (Compute Module, Pi 4/5) with rugged enclosures.
- Add UPS HATs or DC-DC converters to handle 24 VDC inputs and ride through power dips.
- Integrate digital isolation when interfacing with high-voltage signals.

## 3. Software Stack

- Deploy 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Lite for minimal footprint.
- Containerize applications with Docker; define Compose stacks for reproducibility.
- Use Ansible or GitOps pipelines to manage fleet configurations.

## 4. Reliability Practices

- Store code and data on SSD/NVMe rather than SD cards to reduce wear.
- Monitor temperature and throttle conditions; add heatsinks and fans if necessary.
- Enable watchdog timers to auto-reboot on lockups.
- Implement store-and-forward queues for network outages.

## 5. Security

- Harden SSH access, disable default accounts, and enforce key-based logins.
- Segment networks; use VLANs and firewalls to prevent lateral movement.
- Apply automatic security updates during maintenance windows.
- Encrypt sensitive data and rotate certificates regularly.

## 6. Integration with PLCs

- Communicate via OPC UA, Modbus, Ethernet/IP drivers, or vendor APIs.
- Respect PLC scan times; avoid excessive polling and implement caching.
- Document write permissions and apply role-based access to prevent unauthorized control.

## 7. Compliance and Validation

- Validate Pi-based solutions just like any automation component: run FAT/SAT, document tests, and include them in change management.
- Use CE/UL-rated enclosures when required by plant standards.

## 8. Case Example

At a beverage plant, we deployed Pi gateways beside CompactLogix PLCs to stream production metrics into Power BI. By offloading reporting to the Pi, we avoided costly PLC upgrades and achieved a payback in under two months.

When engineered responsibly, Raspberry Pi platforms unlock modern connectivity and analytics while letting PLCs focus on real-time control.
