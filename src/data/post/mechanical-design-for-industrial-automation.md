# Mechanical Design Principles for Industrial Automation

Before specializing in automation and IIoT, I designed mechanical systems for custom machinery. That experience still guides every project. Here are the principles I apply to ensure mechanical designs integrate seamlessly with controls, safety, and data collection.

## 1. Design with Control Strategy in Mind

- Define motion profiles jointly with controls engineers to ensure actuators and PLC scan times align.
- Provide mounting points for sensors, cable routing, and service access early in the design.
- Use PackML or similar state models to structure mechanical sequences.

## 2. Prioritize Maintainability

- Specify quick-release mechanisms for components subject to wear.
- Design panels and guards that allow safe access for technicians with minimal downtime.
- Include visual indicators (sight glasses, inspection windows) aligned with sensor placements.

## 3. Balance Rigidity and Flexibility

- Perform FEA on critical frames to prevent vibration issues that degrade sensor accuracy.
- Incorporate adjustable fixtures or modular tooling for product changeovers.
- Use standardized components (bearings, cylinders) to simplify spare part management.

## 4. Integrate Safety from the Start

- Map out risk assessments (ISO 12100) before finalizing layouts.
- Provide clear segregation of energy sources for lockout/tagout.
- Coordinate safety-rated devices (light curtains, safety PLCs) with mechanical guarding.

## 5. Enable Smart Sensing

- Reserve space for condition monitoring (accelerometers, thermal cameras) even if not installed initially.
- Add reference features for camera calibration and machine vision upgrades.
- Route cables and conduit to minimize electrical noise impacting sensors.

## 6. Document Thoroughly

- Deliver 3D models, exploded views, and BOMs along with electrical and pneumatic schematics.
- Annotate drawings with torque specs, lubrication schedules, and inspection intervals.
- Maintain a revision history accessible to maintenance and engineering teams.

## 7. Collaborate Across Disciplines

- Run design reviews that include operators, safety, controls, and maintenance.
- Prototype critical mechanisms with rapid manufacturing to validate ergonomics and sensor placement.
- Capture lessons learned after commissioning to refine future designs.

Mechanical design sets the foundation for reliable automation. By aligning mechanical, electrical, and software considerations from day one, you create machines that are safe, maintainable, and ready for Industry 4.0 enhancements.
