# MQTT Version Comparison: 3.1.1 vs 5.0

Most industrial MQTT deployments still run on version 3.1.1, but version 5.0 introduces features that simplify operations and improve observability. Here’s what changed and how I decide when to adopt 5.0.

## 1. Session and State Management

| Feature | MQTT 3.1.1 | MQTT 5.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session expiry | Persistent or clean session only | Configurable expiry (seconds) |
| Shared subscriptions | Broker-specific extensions | Standardized |
| Topic aliases | Not available | Reduces payload size |

## 2. Enhanced Messaging Controls

- **Reason codes:** Detailed acknowledgement results help diagnose issues quickly.
- **User properties:** Custom key-value metadata per message.
- **Message expiry:** Set per message TTLs for time-sensitive data.

## 3. Operational Insights

- **Server disconnect packets:** Brokers can explain why connections closed.
- **Request/response pattern:** Response topics standardize RPC-style interactions.
- **Subscription identifiers:** Track which subscription delivered a message.

## 4. When to Stay on 3.1.1

- Legacy clients that cannot be upgraded (embedded devices, older PLC libraries).
- Environments where simplicity and minimal footprint are priorities.
- When broker and client features already cover your needs via extensions.

## 5. When to Adopt 5.0

- You need standardized shared subscriptions for load balancing analytics workloads.
- Observability is critical; reason codes and user properties enable better monitoring.
- You want to reduce bandwidth by leveraging topic aliases and message expiry.

## 6. Migration Strategy

1. Ensure your broker supports both versions (HiveMQ, EMQX, Mosquitto ≥ 1.6).
2. Upgrade clients gradually, validating compatibility in a staging environment.
3. Use feature negotiation—clients announce supported features during CONNECT.
4. Update security policies to cover new features (user properties may contain sensitive data).

MQTT 5.0 is backward-compatible, so you can transition at your own pace. Evaluate the benefits relative to your project goals, and introduce 5.0 capabilities where they deliver clear operational gains.
