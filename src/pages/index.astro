      <p>
        I am a Mechanical Engineer by training and an Automation Engineer by passion. Over the past seven years, I have
        solved complex industrial challenges—from bespoke machinery to multi-site automation rollouts—by uniting control
        hardware, software, and data.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Recognizing that the future of manufacturing is in data, I now focus on building the complete Industrial
        Internet of Things (IIoT) stack. I architect secure, scalable pipelines that capture shop-floor signals,
        contextualize them at the edge, and deliver trustworthy insights to decision makers in the cloud.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My multi-platform expertise lets me choose the right tool for every project. Whether you run Siemens, Allen-
        Bradley, Mitsubishi, CODESYS, or ABB systems, I deliver maintainable logic, structured documentation, and a
        smooth handover to your operations team.
