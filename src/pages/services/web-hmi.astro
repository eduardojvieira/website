    items={[
      {
        title: 'What technologies do you use for web-based HMIs?',
        description:
          'I primarily use Node.js for backend development, with frameworks like Express for API development. For frontend development, I use modern JavaScript frameworks such as Angular or React, combined with visualization libraries like D3.js or Chart.js for data representation. The specific technology stack is selected based on your requirements and existing infrastructure.',
      },
      {
        title: 'How do web-based HMIs communicate with industrial equipment?',
        description:
          'Web-based HMIs typically communicate with industrial equipment through an intermediate server that implements the appropriate industrial protocols (Modbus, OPC UA, EtherNet/IP, etc.). This server acts as a bridge between the web interface and the industrial equipment, handling protocol conversion, data processing, and security.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Are web-based HMIs secure enough for industrial applications?',
        description:
          'Yes, when properly implemented. I incorporate multiple security layers including HTTPS encryption, secure authentication, role-based access control, input validation, and regular security updates. For critical systems, additional security measures such as VPN access, network segregation, and intrusion detection can be implemented.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Can web-based HMIs work offline or with intermittent connectivity?',
        description:
          'Yes, I can implement offline capabilities using modern web technologies like Service Workers and IndexedDB. This allows the HMI to continue functioning during temporary network outages, with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored. For applications requiring high availability, redundant communication paths can also be implemented.',
      },
      {
        title: 'How do you handle real-time updates in web-based HMIs?',
        description:
          'I implement real-time updates using technologies like WebSockets or Server-Sent Events, which allow for efficient, low-latency communication between the server and the browser. This ensures that operators always see the current state of the system without needing to manually refresh the interface.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Can you integrate with our existing SCADA or control systems?',
        description:
          'Yes, I specialize in integrating web-based HMIs with existing systems. This can be done through various methods including OPC UA, database integration, API connections, or direct protocol implementation. The integration approach is selected based on your existing systems and specific requirements.',
