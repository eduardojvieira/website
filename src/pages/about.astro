      <p>
        My career began on the factory floor designing mechanical systems and writing PLC logic for custom equipment.
        That experience taught me how production teams operate, where downtime originates, and how critical it is to
        deliver dependable control solutions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As Industry 4.0 accelerated, I leaned into the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Today I build the full data
        pipeline—connecting controllers, edge devices, MQTT brokers, and cloud platforms—so organizations can monitor
        operations in real time, reduce downtime, and capture actionable insights.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I thrive on complex, multi-platform environments. Whether a project calls for Siemens, Allen-Bradley,
        Mitsubishi, ABB, or CODESYS, I select the right tools, document every step, and deliver systems your team can
        own with confidence.
