I am a highly skilled Robotics, Automation, and Programming Engineer with over 6 years of experience in developing and integrating industrial control systems. My core focus is on Raspberry Pi programming, PLC integration, and web-based HMIs, where I specialize in creating reliable, cost-effective solutions that streamline manufacturing and production processes. Key Skills Industrial Automation: End-to-end design, development, and deployment of industrial systems, including PLC integration, sensor data acquisition, and real-time process control. Raspberry Pi Development: Kiosk-mode applications, customized OS builds, and hardware integration for industrial environments. Web-Based HMI: Experience using Node.js, Angular, and other web technologies to create intuitive, real-time interfaces for machine operation and monitoring. MQTT / IoT: Expertise in setting up secure, low-latency IoT communication for industrial controllers, bridging data between the cloud and shop-floor devices. Programming Languages: Proficient in Python, C, MATLAB, and JavaScript. Professional Highlights Concrete Curing Controller: Main programmer for a large-scale automation system that leverages Raspberry Pi (with Node.js and Angular) and a PLC using MQTT for two-way data exchange. This system has been running continuously for 18+ months with minimal downtime. Industrial HMI Development: Delivered multiple kiosk-mode HMIs featuring integrated camera feeds, sensor data visualization, and real-time control actions for shop-floor operators. System Reliability & Updates: Experienced in implementing robust error handling, continuous monitoring, and user-friendly update mechanisms in production environments. Why Work With Me Proven Track Record: I have successfully transitioned multiple pilot projects into stable, production-level deployments in industrial settings. Clear Communication: I excel at coordinating with cross-functional teams—mechanical, electrical, and software engineers—to keep projects running smoothly. Flexibility: Currently available 10 hours/week, with potential for increasing to full-time if our collaboration and project requirements grow. Client Satisfaction: A 100% Job Success score and positive feedback on Upwork, reflecting my commitment to quality and continuous improvement. If you need a reliable Raspberry Pi Developer who can expertly integrate industrial hardware, firmware, and user interfaces, I’m here to help. Let’s discuss how we can collaborate to optimize and enhance your industrial systems. Location: Buenos Aires, Argentina (Available for remote collaboration) I look forward to partnering with you to create a smarter, more efficient industrial process. Let’s get started!
